# Overview

This tutorial will demonstrate some of the more advanced features of DART's
dynamics API which allow you to write robust controllers that work for real
dynamic systems, such as robotic manipulators. We will show you how to:

- Clone Skeletons
- Load a URDF
- Write a stable PD controller w/ gravity and coriolis compensation
- Write an operational space controller
