\section{Overview}
The following document describes the construction of the matrices responsible for solving LCP (linear-complimentarity problems) for articulated rigid bodies in generalized coordinates. The document assumes familiarity with the mathematical construction of LCP. This was originally intended as a guide for the implementation of the LCP solver for the DART dynamics library.

\section{Introduction}
The following document describes the construction of the matrices responsible for contact handling for articulated rigid bodies in generalized coordinates. We formulate an implicit time-stepping, velocity-based LCP (linear-complementarity problem) to guarantee non-penetration, directional friction, and approximated Coulombâ€™s friction cone conditions, similar to Stewart and Trinkle \cite{Stewart:1996}. The document assumes familiarity with physics principles of frictional contact and the mathematical techniques for solving standard LCP. This was originally intended as a guide for the implementation of the LCP solver for the DART dynamics library.
