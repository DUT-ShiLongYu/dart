#    DART_MINOR_VERSION
#    DART_PATCH_VERSION

# Exceptions: this section can depend on hard-coded version numbers. All that 
# should be done here is marking versions incompatiable that would generally be
# compatible (e.g., set(PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE FALSE)).
# Furthermore, it only makes sense for these hard-coded version numbers to be
# the current or previous versions of Simbody.

# Nothing to put here yet.
