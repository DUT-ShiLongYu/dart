/// AddonManager is a base class that should be virtually inherited by any class
/// that wants to be able to manage Addons.
///
/// The base AddonManager class is completely agnostic to what kind of Addons it
/// is given. Addons are stored in a std::map, so access to its Addons happens
/// on average in log(N) time. Most often, a class that accepts Addons will have
/// certain Addon types that it will need to access frequently, and it would be
/// beneficial to have constant-time access to those Addon types. To get
/// constant-time access to specific Addon types, there are FOUR macros that you
/// should use in your derived class:
///
/// DART_ENABLE_ADDON_SPECIALIZATION() must be declared once in the derived
/// class's definition, under a 'public:' declaration range.
///
/// DART_SPECIALIZE_ADDON_INTERNAL( AddonType ) must be declared once for each
/// AddonType that you want to specialize. It should be placed in the derived
/// class's definition, under a 'public:' declaration range.
///
/// DART_SPECIALIZE_ADDON_EXTERNAL( Derived, AddonType ) must be declared once
/// for each AddonType that you want to specialize. It should be placed
/// immediately after the class's definition in the same header file as the
/// derived class, inside of the same namespace as the derived class. This macro
/// defines a series of templated functions, so it should go in a header, and
/// not in a source file.
///
/// DART_INSTANTIATE_SPECIALIZED_ADDON( AddonType ) must be declared once for
/// each AddonType that you want to specialize. It should be placed inside the
/// constructor of the derived class, preferably before anything else is done
/// inside the body of the constructor.
